</div>
<p>Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University (HSTU), Dinajpur-5200, Bangladesh</p>

During the Covid-19 pandemic, I had the opportunity to participate in a research project led by Dr. Md. Arshad Ali  to develop a biometric attendance system using smart IoT device. Together with my team, we built the system from the ground up under his guidance.
- Gained valuable experience working with Raspberry Pi computers and fingerprint sensors for biometric data collection.
- Learned back-end development and contributed to the system's database design and server integration.
- Collaborated closely with team members to troubleshoot and optimize system performance.
- Assisted in testing and debugging the system to ensure accuracy and reliability.

This project inspired me to create solutions for real-world problems and gave me an overview of the entire system development lifecycle. It proved valuable in later semesters when I worked with my team on multiple projects to meet course requirements.
