**Semesters Taught:** Fall 2024

This course provided an introduction to the fundamental concepts of database systems. Students learned about data models, database architecture, relational algebra and calculus, normalization, and transaction processing. Emphasis was placed on both the theoretical foundations and the practical aspects of database design and management.

The associated lab component (CSE-308) offered hands-on experience in creating and managing databases using SQL. Students implemented relational schemas, wrote complex queries, and developed stored procedures, triggers, and transactions to solve real-world data management problems.

Syllabus Overview
======
- **Introduction:** Database system concepts and architecture, Data models schema and instances, Data independence and data base language and interface, Data definition languages, DML, Overall data base structure.
