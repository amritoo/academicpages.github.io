This course introduced students to the fundamental principles of electronic commerce (e-commerce), mobile commerce (m-commerce), and web engineering. Students learned about the technological infrastructure supporting online business, including the internet, web servers, security mechanisms, and various e-commerce frameworks. The course also covered web marketing strategies, electronic payment systems, legal and ethical considerations, and the transition from e-commerce to m-commerce. Emphasis was placed on understanding both the technical and business aspects of web-based commercial systems.
