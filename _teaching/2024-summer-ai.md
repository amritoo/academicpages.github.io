**Semesters Taught:** Summer 2024, Fall 2024

This course introduced students to the foundational concepts and techniques of Artificial Intelligence (AI), covering key areas such as machine learning, pattern recognition, expert systems, and neural networks. Emphasis was placed on both theoretical understanding and practical applications. Students explored heuristic problem-solving strategies, natural language understanding, and various models of knowledge representation. The course also provided exposure to AI programming languages such as LISP and PROLOG.

The associated lab component (CSE-408) focused on hands-on experience with machine learning techniques. Students developed, trained, and evaluated models to address real-world problems using modern tools and libraries.
