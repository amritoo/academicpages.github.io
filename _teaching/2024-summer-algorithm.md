**Semesters Taught:** Summer 2024

This course provided an in-depth introduction to the design and analysis of algorithms. Emphasis was placed on understanding algorithmic strategies, analyzing computational complexity, and applying mathematical tools for rigorous performance analysis. Students explored fundamental paradigms such as divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms, alongside advanced data structures and graph algorithms. Practical problem-solving and theoretical underpinnings were balanced throughout.

The associated lab component (CSE-302) provided hands-on experience in implementing and analyzing algorithms. Students designed, developed, and tested algorithmic solutions to real-world problems, reinforcing concepts from the theoretical course through practical application.
