**Semesters Taught:** Summer 2024

This course introduced students to the foundational principles of data communication and networking. It covered essential topics ranging from transmission fundamentals to protocols, media, and switching techniques. Emphasis was placed on understanding how data is transmitted and encoded across different media, the structure and behavior of communication networks, and the protocols that enable reliable data exchange. The course also offered an introduction to the telecommunications infrastructure, including the public telephone system.
