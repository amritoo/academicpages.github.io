**Semesters Taught:** Spring 2025

This course provided students with a solid foundation in digital systems, Boolean algebra, and logic circuit design. It introduced number systems, combinational and sequential logic circuits, logic families, and memory devices. Emphasis was placed on the design, analysis, and simplification of digital circuits. The course also covered real-world troubleshooting and applications.

The associated lab component (0713-204) offered hands-on experience in designing and implementing digital circuits using basic and universal logic gates. Students built and tested circuits, gaining practical skills in circuit analysis, logic simulation, and digital hardware implementation.
