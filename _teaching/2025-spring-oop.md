**Semesters Taught:** Fall 2024, Spring 2025

This course provided students with a comprehensive understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and their practical implementation using Java. Core concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction were explored through hands-on coding and structured problem-solving. The course also introduced Java-specific syntax, data structures, and multithreading, enabling students to write efficient, modular, and scalable programs.

The associated lab component (0613-202) focused on applying theoretical concepts in real-world scenarios. Students developed Java-based applications, solved algorithmic problems, and built small-scale projects. They also participated in competitive programming sessions using Java, strengthening both their coding proficiency and problem-solving skills.
